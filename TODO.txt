Note editing:
  The textarea is grey text, not black.

Date editing - only dates until 2013 are allowed. Why?

Create a better model where dates are elements of groups rather than two
independent arrays.

Groups page:
  Upon creating a New Group, sort the groups alphabetically.

Details list page:
  New Detail
  Delete Group
  Edit Group

Edit date details page:
  Replace table cruft with CSS.
  Compute diff
  Display diff
  
Add toolbar at bottom:
  Settings
  Info
    
Settings brings up Settings dialog
Info brings up Info page

Persist the data to local storage upon change.
Load the data from local storage on startup.

Limitations:
  Cannot move events between groups.
