Known bugs:
  Creating a group with a duplicate name alerts, but closes the name editing
  dialog. How to prevent it cancelling the dialog?

  Creating a new entry setting date a to a date, leaving b locked sets both
  dates to locked, 0 total days. Subsequent re-editing of date is ok, date
  has a duration.
  
Limitations:
  Cannot move events between groups.
  Dates cannot be entered that are more than +/- 100 years from today.
